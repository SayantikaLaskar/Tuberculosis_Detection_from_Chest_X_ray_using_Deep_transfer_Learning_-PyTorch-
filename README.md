# 🩺Tuberculosis_Detection_from_Chest_X_ray_using_Deep_transfer_Learning_-PyTorch📸
This repository contains the code for detecting TB from chest X-ray images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch.

🔍 Features:

- Utilizes deep transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, etc., for TB detection.
- Preprocesses chest X-ray images for optimal model input.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provides visualization tools to interpret model predictions and performance metrics.
